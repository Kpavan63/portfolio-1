## 🛡️ My Approach to Ethical Hacking

My core focus is **proactive defense**. As a security researcher and ethical hacker, I aim to find and fix vulnerabilities before malicious attackers can exploit them. Through comprehensive testing, analysis, and security automation, I ensure that systems remain secure.
